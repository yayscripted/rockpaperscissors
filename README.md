# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Overview: 
In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game will take user choice, generate a computer choice, and display the winner to the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, the Math Library to generate a random choice, and conditionals to determine the winner.

## Day 2

### Javascript 

- [x] Outside of your click handler, declare 3 variables (userChoice, computerChoice and winner) and assign them values of empty strings
- [x] Outside of your click handler, declare a randomNumber variable and set it equal to 0
- [x] In your click handler, generate a random number and assign it to the randomNumber variable
- [x] In your click handler, store the input value in the userChoice variable	
- [x] In your click handler, display userChoice to the screen
#### Wrap
- [x] Push your changes!

## Day 3

## JavaScript
- [x] Write a conditional statement which, given the number range of randomNumber, assigns ‘rock’, ‘paper’ or ‘scissors’ to the computerChoice variable 
- [x] Display the computerChoice to the screen
- [x] Write a conditional statement that compares the userChoice to the computerChoice to determine the winner of the game
- [x] Display the winner to the screen in the result div
- [x] Clear the input value once a result is displayed

#### Wrap
- [x] Push your changes!

## Projects Extensions:
- [x] Style the page to fit your personality
- [x] Validates input so that it will return “Not valid input” if the user types in a wrong choice. 
- [x] Accepts any form of a word regardless of capitalization (i.e. “Rock” “rock” roCk”)
- [x] Keeps track of total wins and losses, until the page refreshes.
